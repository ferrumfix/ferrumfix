# Configuration for the Zepter CLI to ensure correct feature configuration in the Rust workspace.

version:
  # File format for parsing it:
  format: 1
  # Minimum version of the binary that is expected to work. This is just for printing a nice error
  # message when someone tries to use an older version.
  binary: 1.0.0

# The examples in this file assume crate `A` to have a dependency on crate `B`.
workflows:
  # Check that everything is good without modifying anything:
  check:
    - [
        'lint',
        # Check that `A` activates the features of `B`.
        'propagate-feature',
        '--all-features',
        '--features=codegen',
        # Do not try to add a new section into `[features]` of `A` only because `B` expose that feature. There are edge-cases where this is still needed, but we can add them manually.
        '--left-side-feature-missing=ignore',
        # Ignore the case that `A` it outside of the workspace. Otherwise it will report errors in external dependencies that we have no influence on.
        '--left-side-outside-workspace=ignore',
        # Show the paths of failed crates to have them clickable in the terminal:Â 
        '--show-path',
      ]
      # Format the features into canonical format:
    - ['format', 'features', '--offline', '--locked', '--quiet']
  # Same as `check`, but actually fix the issues instead of just reporting them:
  default:
    - [ $check.0, '--fix' ]
    - [ $check.1, '--fix' ]

# Will be displayed when any workflow fails:

    FerrumFIX uses the Zepter CLI to detect abnormalities in the feature configuration.
    It looks like one more more checks failed; please check the console output. You can try to automatically address them by running `zepter`.
    Otherwise please ask directly in a GitHub issue or on Discord, thank you.
